        Ralph has always spent most of his time with his kids when they were a lot younger, they would often listen to music and watch movies on television.
As they got older, they started listening to Elvis Presly. He became Ralph's favorite song artist. Whenever he plays those songs, he always thinks of his kids.
Recently he became a grandfather. He loved playing with his grandkids while they were growing. He would share the movies he watched with his kids with them and he even played some of Elvis' songs whenever they visited. As they began to grow older, Ralph has been looking through more songs created during the 1960s and he wants to share the songs with them. However he is unsure if they will like the songs he found. He wants to find a way to help his grandkids find songs that are similar to Elvis' work so he can stay connected with them. He would also talk to them about the times he was over in Europe during the Vietnam war, making sure nothing happened there during that peroid of time.
He found the Genermedia app in the app store on his new cell phone that he got recently. His grandkids told him about the app and downloaded it. He joined their group on the app and he shared Youtube videos that were converted into mp3 files that played Elvis' songs. They shared some of the songs they liked with him such as Funky Town, Satisfaction, and Rock you like a Hurricane. Ralph also took pictures of some of his uniforms and medals he had earned when he was in the military. He also recorded stories of him speaking about each one of those objects and what their significant purpose is. With this app, Ralph feels much closer to his family.

Mary
<br>
32 years old, female, history teacher.
Mary enjoys learning about history from those who were involved in those historical events. She often visits historical places as well.
Goal and challenges: Mary wants to teach her students about things that actually happened throughout history. Since some people are trying to cover up history today, it's making it harder for her to teach her students about events that aren't in the books and them being told that it didn't happen.

<div id ="research">With the information I’ve gathered for my project. Some members of different generations are connected while others are not.
Through some of my observation in the past on the newer generation, they tend to like things from older generations when exposed to it at an early age. One of my younger cousins got a small scale Centipede arcade machine for Christmas at my grandparents’ house. She loved it and she was playing it for hours. There was another time she and her sister were over there while I was present. My uncles set up their old Atari system and they were hooked on the games they had. However at their current age, they don’t fully understand some of the historical things that have happened in the past.
When it comes to my dad. Him and I would often play Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 and Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo Wii. With the Rabbids game, he often sees that as a hilarious game. He was also a part time dj and he got me into the type of music that I like today. He enjoys songs from the 60s to the early 2000s. He does often enjoy some modern day movies and songs.
My grandfather happens to like music and movies from his age back in the late 1930s-50s, but he likes to share the movies he has with me and my cousins. His favorite movies were The Wizard of Oz, My Friend Flicka, and Gone With the Wind. My mom and her siblings would watch those movies with him. I’ve watched the Wizard of Oz with him when I was a kid,. Some of his favorite singers were Ben Crosby, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, and Patty Page.  He sometimes talks about things that happened in past when he was around my age and I enjoy listening to his stories. One of them was that he was stationed over in Europe during the Vietnam War.  With today’s media, he often enjoys funny movies.
